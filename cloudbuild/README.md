# Google cloud build based release builds
This cloud build generates a release image, tags it with "[branch-name]-[build-id]", and pushes the image to a docker repo and the tag back to the build repo.
Build-id is generated by counting the number of commits between the root commit and HEAD of the branch.

## Cloud build configuration
The cloud build is triggered by a trigger that
- Reacts on pushes to a branch
- Uses "cloudbuild/cloudbuild.yaml" as its configuration
